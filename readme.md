# TYPESCRIPT is an open source, typed syntatic superset of JavaScript, Maintained by Microsoft

Unfortunately, we can't directly run Typescript on terminal

npm install -g typescript

tsc file_name.ts && node file_name.js

TYPESCRIPT WILL GIVE ERROR IF YOU RUN `node file_name.js`, OF DUPLICATE FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATION

const DECLARATIONS MUST BE INITIALIZED

# Why TYPESCRIPT with REACT?

Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.

makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.

## TYPESCRIPT CRA TEMPLATE:

npx create-react-app <APP_NAME> --template typescript
